# [347. Top K Frequent Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-vertical-order-traversal/)

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the `k` most frequent elements. You may return the answer in any order.

Constraints:

- 1 <= `nums.length` <= 105
- -104 <= `nums[i]` <= 104
- `k` is in the range [1, the number of unique elements in the array].
- It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.


Follow up: Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than O(n log n), where n is the array's size.

## Solution

## Examples

### Example 1

Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1,2]

### Example 2

Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]
